An API Server for UniCS's networking platform for its members at the University of Manchester.

## Getting Started

- Install [Node.js v12 or v14](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install Docker:
	- **Linux**: first install [the engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server), then install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
	- **Windows**: install [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
	- **Mac** - install [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- Verify that the installations have succeeded. You should be able to run these commands and get similar output:
	```
	$ node --version
	v14.5.0

	$ npm --version
	6.14.5

	$ make --version
	GNU Make 4.1
	...

	$ docker --version
	Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe

	$ docker-compose --version
	docker-compose version 1.25.5, build 8a1c60f6
	```
- Clone the repo, and install the Node.js dependencies of this project:
	```bash
	$ git clone git@github.com:unicsmcr/unics_social_api.git
	# or you can clone with HTTPS

	$ cd unics_social_api

	$ npm install
	```
- You now need to create an `.env` file - this is a configuration file for the project. You can just copy the included `.env.example` to create yours. I would not recommend changing it unless the existing values cause problems.
- Launch the PostgreSQL database and its admin tool:
	```
	$ docker-compose up -d
	```

	> The `-d` flag means detached, and allows the services to run in the background and not block your terminal.
	>
	> To access the admin tool, head to `http://localhost:5050` in your web browser, and use `admin@admin.com` and `password` as your login details. This allows you to interact with your local instance of the database with a friendly GUI.
- Now you can run the actual UniCS Social Server! Whenever you make changes, you will need to re-run this command.
	```
	$ npm run build && node dist/app
	```
- After you've made changes, you can run tests to ensure that nothing broke and the coverage is still high!
	```
	$ npm test
	```
- You can shutdown the database and its admin tool once you're done:
	```
	$ docker-compose down
	```
